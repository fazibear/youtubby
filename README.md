> For a long time I was looking for desktop Youtube Music Player. With all of them was always something that pissed me off.
> So I write my own. Yep it's in Rust BTW!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's early stage... Right now I'm focusing on MacOS to make it usable as daily driver.

> [!WARNING]  
> There is a weird bug on OSX related to WebKit. After a random time Youtubby starts crackling.
> Did't check other platforms.

Goals:
- MacOS support
- Windows support
- Linux support
- Notification support
- Last.fm support
- Adblock?
- MiniPlayer
- Media Keys Support
- AI (beacuse everything have it ;)
